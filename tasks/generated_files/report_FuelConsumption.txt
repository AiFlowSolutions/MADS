FuelConsumption Report
===============

Problem: Regression
Target Variable: FUEL CONSUMPTION

Columns:
Year, MAKE, MODEL, VEHICLE CLASS, ENGINE SIZE, CYLINDERS, TRANSMISSION, FUEL, FUEL CONSUMPTION, COEMISSIONS

Correlations:
ENGINE SIZE is highly correlated with CYLINDERS and FUEL CONSUMPTION. FUEL CONSUMPTION is highly correlated with COEMISSIONS.

Relevant Insights:
ENGINE SIZE and CYLINDERS are important features for predicting FUEL CONSUMPTION. FUEL CONSUMPTION is highly correlated with COEMISSIONS, which may indicate a strong relationship between fuel consumption and emissions.

Machine Learning Model Used: Random Forest Regressor
Explanation and Alternatives:
The reasons for this choice are: 
1. Regression problem: The problem is a regression problem, and Random Forest Regressor is a suitable model for regression tasks.
2. Feature correlations: The high correlation between ENGINE SIZE and CYLINDERS suggests that these features are important for predicting FUEL CONSUMPTION. Random Forest can handle correlated features effectively.
3. Non-linear relationships: The correlation between FUEL CONSUMPTION and COEMISSIONS may indicate a non-linear relationship. Random Forest can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

Transformations:
Filled missing values with mean, created lag features and rolling mean and standard deviation features

Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and test subsets with a test size of 0.2 and random state 42
