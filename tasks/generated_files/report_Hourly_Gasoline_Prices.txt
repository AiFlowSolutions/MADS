Data set name: Hourly_Gasoline_Prices
User problem: Time-series forecasting
Target variable: Price
Columns: Id, isSelf, Price, Date
Correlations: Strong negative correlation between isSelf and Price, weak negative correlation between Id and Price, and weak negative correlation between Id and isSelf
Relevant insights: The correlations suggest that isSelf has a significant impact on Price, and Id has a smaller impact on Price and isSelf
Machine learning model used: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model
Explanation and alternatives: ARIMA is suitable for this problem because it can handle non-stationary time series data, which is common in hourly price data. It can also capture patterns and trends in the data. Alternative models could be Prophet, LSTM, or SARIMA, but ARIMA is a good starting point due to its simplicity and interpretability.
Transformations: Filled missing values with the mean of the 'Price' column, created lag features, created rolling mean and standard deviation features
Metrics of the evaluations of the predictions: RMSE: 0.1800950273963919, MAE: 0.14422423647412985
