Problem: Classification
Target variable: Diagnosis
Columns: WBC, LYMp, NEUTp, LYMn, NEUTn, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, PDW, PCT, and Diagnosis
Correlations: 
The correlation matrix shows that some columns are highly correlated with each other. For example, WBC and LYMn have a correlation coefficient of 0.379974, which indicates a moderate positive correlation. Similarly, HGB and HCT have a correlation coefficient of 0.135668, which indicates a moderate positive correlation.
Relevant insights: 
The analysis revealed correlations between some of the numeric columns, which could be useful for building a classification model.
Machine learning model used: Random Forest Classifier
Explanation and alternatives: 
The Random Forest Classifier is chosen due to its ability to handle correlated features, high-dimensional data, and its proven performance in classification problems. Other alternatives could be Gradient Boosting Classifier or Support Vector Machines (SVM), but Random Forest is a more robust choice given the correlations in the data.
Transformations: 
Filled missing values with mean, scaled the data using StandardScaler
Splitting: 
Split the dataset into training and test subsets with a test size of 0.2
ML model used: Random Forest Classifier
