Assistant: This is my problem: I want to forecast the shampoos sale. What is the Machine learning problem?
Context: 
The needed data is in datasets/sales-of-shampoo-over-a-three-ye.csv
User: Let's analyze the problem.

To read the data, you can use the following Python code:
```
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('datasets/sales-of-shampoo-over-a-three-ye.csv')
print(data.head())
```
This will give us an idea of what the data looks like.

Based on your problem statement, it seems like you want to forecast shampoo sales. This suggests that you're dealing with a **time-series forecasting problem**. You want to predict future sales based on historical data.

To confirm, can you please run the above code and share the output? This will help me better understand the structure of your data.

User: Based on the output, it's clear that we're dealing with a **time-series forecasting problem**. The data consists of monthly sales of shampoo over a three-year period, and we want to forecast future sales.

To summarize:

1. We've successfully read the data using `pd.read_csv`.
2. The problem type is **time-series forecasting**.
3. The feature is the `Month`, and the target variable is `Sales of shampoo over a three year period`.

ValueError: could not convert string to float: '1-Jan'

User: The error is because the `corr` function is trying to calculate the correlation between the 'Month' column (which is a string) and the 'Sales of shampoo over a three year period' column (which is a float). 

Since the 'Month' column is a string, it can't be converted to a float, which is why we're getting this error.

Let's skip the 'Month' column and calculate the correlation only for the 'Sales of shampoo over a three year period' column. However, since there's only one numerical column, the correlation will be 1.0.

Let's move on to the next step.

User: Based on the provided dataset and insights, I recommend using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time-series forecasting. This model is suitable for this problem due to the following reasons:

1. The dataset has a single numerical column (Sales of shampoo over a three year period) with 36 entries, which is a typical scenario for time-series forecasting.
2. The data exhibits a clear pattern, with a mean of 312.6 and a standard deviation of 148.94, indicating that the sales data has some degree of seasonality and trend.
3. ARIMA is a popular and widely used model for time-series forecasting, particularly suitable for datasets with strong seasonal components.

ARIMA is a suitable model for this problem due to the single numerical column with 36 entries, exhibiting a clear pattern with seasonality and trend. Alternative models could be Prophet, LSTM, or SARIMA, but ARIMA is a popular and widely used model for time-series forecasting.
---
*Transformations*:
`Filled missing values with mean, created lag features, and rolling mean and standard deviation features`
---
*Splitting*:
`Split the dataset into training and test subsets with a test size of 0.2`
